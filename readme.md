This tutorial is a part of IEEE Brain virtual summer school 2020. It contains basic Python codes for EMG data processing, and the Python codes for two simple computational tasks related to EMG. A brief introduction about how the data were collected can be found in the powerpoint file under the same folder.

Anaconda is highly recommended here. It can help you set up your own Python based scientific computation environment easily. You can install and begin to use Anaconda following [this link](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

We will heavily use Python packages including numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sklearn in this tutorial. Check [this link](https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/4.3.1/user-guide/getting-started/?highlight=numpy#adding-scipy-and-numpy-packages) to find out how to add them into your environment if you are new in Python. 

When your environment is set, use `git` to clone this repo or simply download it to your local machine. Use jupyter notebook to open this file. Tips on how to use jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html).

There are some functions wrapped in `EMG_processing_lib.py` under the same folder. Check that file and find out how you could use it or modify it for your own analyses. 

All data were collected in Miller Limb Lab, Northwestern University. Data are available only for learning purpose. Send an email to xuan.ma1@northwestern.edu if you want to play with the data by yourself.
